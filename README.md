# :rainbow: Names of colors used in ggplot2

`ggplot2` is an awesome library for R. It allows you to plot almost everything. One of my favorite features of ggplot2 is that plots are very cute by default. But, of course, one can always make them better using relevant (or trendy) colors.

Colors can be called by name (instead of #FFUU84 codes) in ggplot2. It is difficult for me to keep these names in memory, so I've written some code. It generates two tables: one with `grey`s (`gray`s?) and another with colors.

I have to admit that the code and the tables look like shit. They will be updated as soon as possible.
